In my belief, technology is completely neutral. This facet of humanity is amoral, with the qualities of “good” and “evil” only applying to the usage and application of technology. My reasoning behind this stems from the examples throughout human history and my own personal life that has influenced my opinion. Some of the inventions of the world heralded as advances for the positive good have been used for dastardly acts. Dynamite, chlorine gas, and the Gatling gun were supposed to provide a strong defensive measure against the act of war, but was instead used in vicious battlefields and genocides. Nuclear power, was used both as a positive and a negative as an alternative to fossil fuel, but also as both pushing humanity closer to Armageddon, while at the same time providing an ultimate deterrent for the outbreak of World War 3. At the same time, humanity has used technologies in saving tremendous lives. The usage of fungi and disease like cowpox alone aren’t explicitly positive and in many cases may be negative. Yet the invention of penicillin and the smallpox vaccine greatly alleviated human suffering across the globe. The practice of selectively breeding crops by itself is neutral, yet its applications in the 1960’s prompted the Green Revolution which was able to feed billions of human beings in the developing world. Thus, technology itself is neutral, it just depends on how humanity uses and applies it.
